# Selecting-algorithm
Self-projected solution for expanded version of the Jossephus Problem.
Copy of the code from the A&DS (Algorithms and Data Structures) project developed around 
Based on use of mathematical analyze of next countings of the selected group and on the Closed-form expression for that problem. 
Presented code can easily search equal element of the whole group which would be "eliminated" in indicated place(enumeration). 
Whole structure of that code allowing to work on the uint64 long groups. 
Actually eliminated element is allways the second one in counting from the previously eliminated one. (eg. for a group 0,1,2 order of elimination will be: 1,0,2).
